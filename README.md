# MercadoLibre-Challenge
This challenge is an e-commerce app of MercadoLibre. It was entirely developed using **Typescript+React.js**. The style was enhanced with **Chakra-ui** and the navigation between pages (*Homepage / ProductPage*) was able using **react-router-dom** package. The features are: in *HomePage* you can see an **image slider carrusel** that allows you to cycle through images using  back & forward buttons, a **modal** that appears when the cursor is positioned over *Categories* tag and a you can navigate to productPage after click on the carrousel component. in *productPage*, the product info refers to one example and you can see a **principal image** that changes when you pass (*hover effect*) over **miniature images** located aside the picture. A product description section with a clickable (*Add to cart*) button that allow you **add items** and a **Go to Cart** section that redirect to your cart containing your product. A section *Ask & Answer* with a **input form** that allow to introduce a question (e.g. are other colors available?)  In the *Cart  section* you can modify the quantities and /or *remove* it from your list.
